== README

This is a basic blogger app, generated with rails g scaffold. I then implemented Devise with Facebook OAuth ontop of that. Feel free to use as a skeleton for any projects, just credit me please.
Also note you will need a Facebook Developer account, and to create an app so that you have the app_id and app_secret. Put these in a /config/application.yml if using Figaro, or secrets.yml otherwisee.
Put those two files on your .gitignore - sharing keys publicly is a no-no.

=NEXT STEPS
-Implement a logout button
-Add CSS
